## About These Docs

This documentation is a living collection of notes, workflows, and tutorials that I've written for myself and others throughout my career. The goal is to have a single place where I can reference common tasks and share knowledge with my friends, collaborators, and the broader scientific community.

If you find something useful or have suggestions, please reach out at any of my socials found on [my website](https://www.ianwashere.com/)!
