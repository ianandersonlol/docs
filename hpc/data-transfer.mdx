title: Data Transfer
description: Moving data to and from HPC clusters
---

Getting data onto and off of HPC clusters is a common task. This guide covers command-line tools and GUI applications for transferring files.

## Command-Line Tools

### scp (Secure Copy)

Simple file transfers over SSH:

```bash
# Copy file to cluster
scp local_file.txt username@cluster.edu:/path/to/destination/

# Copy file from cluster
scp username@cluster.edu:/path/to/file.txt ./local_destination/

# Copy entire directory (recursive)
scp -r local_directory/ username@cluster.edu:/path/to/destination/
```

<Tip>
  Use `-C` flag to enable compression for faster transfers of compressible files (text, uncompressed data).
</Tip>

### rsync (Recommended for Large Transfers)

More robust than scp—supports resuming interrupted transfers and only copies changed files:

```bash
# Sync local directory to cluster
rsync -avzP local_directory/ username@cluster.edu:/path/to/destination/

# Sync from cluster to local
rsync -avzP username@cluster.edu:/path/to/source/ ./local_destination/
```

**Common flags:**
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-a` | Archive mode (preserves permissions, timestamps, etc.) |
| `-v` | Verbose output |
| `-z` | Compress during transfer |
| `-P` | Show progress + allow resuming partial transfers |
| `--delete` | Delete files in destination that don't exist in source (careful!) |

<Note>
  rsync is ideal for large datasets or ongoing syncs. If a transfer fails partway through, just run the same command again—it picks up where it left off.
</Note>

### sftp (Interactive File Transfer)

Interactive session for browsing and transferring:

```bash
sftp username@cluster.edu
```

Common sftp commands:
- `ls` / `lls` - list remote / local files
- `cd` / `lcd` - change remote / local directory
- `get file.txt` - download file
- `put file.txt` - upload file
- `mget *.csv` - download multiple files
- `mput *.csv` - upload multiple files

## Globus (For Very Large Transfers)

For transferring very large datasets (hundreds of GB or more), Globus provides reliable, high-speed transfers that can resume automatically if interrupted.

<Note>
  Check if your institution has a Globus endpoint set up. Many universities provide Globus access for research data transfers.

## Tips for Large Transfers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use compression wisely">
    - Text files, CSVs, uncompressed data: use `-z` flag or compress before transfer
    - Already compressed files (`.gz`, `.zip`, images, videos): skip compression
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use screen or tmux for long transfers">
    Long transfers can be interrupted if your SSH connection drops. Run transfers inside `screen` or `tmux`:

    ```bash
    # Start a screen session
    screen -S transfer

    # Run your rsync command
    rsync -avzP ...

    # Detach with Ctrl+A, then D
    # Reattach later with: screen -r transfer
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check available space first">
    Before transferring large datasets, verify there's enough space:

    ```bash
    df -h /path/to/destination
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verify transfers completed correctly">
    For critical data, verify with checksums:

    ```bash
    # Generate checksum locally
    md5sum large_file.tar.gz > checksum.md5

    # Transfer both files, then verify on cluster
    md5sum -c checksum.md5
    ```
  </Accordion>
