title: Getting Started with Sherlock
description: Request a Sherlock account and configure access to Stanford's HPC cluster
---

## Prerequisites

- A **SUNet ID** (Stanford University Network ID)
  - Base-level SUNet service is sufficient
  - External collaborators can get a sponsored SUNet ID through their PI

## Request a Sherlock Account

Sherlock accounts are managed through PI groups. To get access:

1. **New lab members**: Have your PI email `srcc-support@stanford.edu` requesting that your SUNet ID be added to their group.

2. **Faculty/PIs**: Email `srcc-support@stanford.edu` with:
   - Your SUNet ID
   - The SUNet IDs of research team members to add

<Note>
  Account requests are typically processed within a few business days. You'll receive an email confirmation when your account is ready.
</Note>

## Connecting to Sherlock

Once your account is approved, you can connect via SSH. Unlike some clusters, Sherlock does **not** require a VPN—you can connect from anywhere.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="SSH">
    Connect from your terminal:

    ```bash
    ssh ianpan@login.sherlock.stanford.edu
    ```

    Replace `ianpan` with your Stanford SUNet ID.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OnDemand (Web)">
    Access Sherlock through a web browser with Jupyter, RStudio, VS Code, and terminal:

    **URL:** [https://ondemand.sherlock.stanford.edu](https://ondemand.sherlock.stanford.edu)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authentication

Sherlock requires **two-factor authentication** (2FA) for all logins.

<Warning>
  **SSH key authentication is NOT supported on Sherlock.** You must use your SUNet ID password plus a two-factor authentication code.
</Warning>

### Two-Factor Authentication Flow

1. Enter your SUNet ID password when prompted
2. You'll receive a Duo push notification or be prompted for a code
3. Approve the push or enter the code from your authenticator app

### Setting Up Duo

If you haven't set up Duo for Stanford services:

1. Go to [https://accounts.stanford.edu](https://accounts.stanford.edu)
2. Set up Duo Mobile or another 2FA method
3. Test your setup before trying to connect to Sherlock

## Login Nodes

Sherlock has **20 login nodes**. When you connect, you'll be automatically assigned to one. These are shared resources—don't run computationally intensive tasks on them.

<Warning>
  Login nodes are for:
  - Editing scripts
  - Submitting jobs
  - Light file management

  They are **not** for:
  - Running calculations
  - Compiling large software
  - Data processing

  Use [interactive sessions](/hpc/stanford/using-sherlock/job-submission#interactive-sessions) for computational work.
</Warning>

## Data Transfer Nodes

For transferring large files, use the dedicated data transfer nodes (DTNs):

```bash
ssh ianpan@dtn.sherlock.stanford.edu
```

Or use tools like `scp`, `rsync`, or Globus pointing to `dtn.sherlock.stanford.edu`.

## Onboarding Sessions

Stanford Research Computing offers one-hour onboarding sessions for new users covering:
- Sherlock layout and architecture
- Job scheduler basics
- File systems
- Job submission and software installation best practices

Check the [SRCC website](https://srcc.stanford.edu/) for the schedule.
