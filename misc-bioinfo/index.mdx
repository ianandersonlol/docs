## What's Covered

Topics in this section could be anything that doesn't fit into the other sections. Currently, there's just a set of instructions and tips for setting up a Mac for bioinformatics, but I might add other things later depending on what speaks to me. This could be figure making or visualization, or it could be general best practices for things like reproducibility. It all kind of is whatever.
