# Troubleshooting Tips

Here are solutions to common issues you might encounter when setting up your bioinformatics environment.

## Permission Issues

<Warning>
  Avoid using `sudo` with Homebrew or conda unless official docs/support explicitly tell you to fix a specific path.
</Warning>

If you encounter permission errors:

1. **For Homebrew**: Run `brew doctor` to diagnose issues
2. **For conda/mamba**: Ensure you're using user-local installations (Miniforge defaults to your home directory)

```bash
# Diagnose first
brew doctor

# Check current Homebrew ownership
ls -ld /opt/homebrew

# Last resort: only run this if `brew doctor` explicitly says to fix ownership
sudo chown -R "$(whoami)":admin /opt/homebrew/Cellar /opt/homebrew/Homebrew
```

## Path Issues

If commands aren't found after installation:

```bash
# Check your PATH
echo $PATH

# Verify a tool's location
which samtools

# Make sure Homebrew is in your PATH
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

### Common PATH Additions

Add these to your `.zshrc` if tools aren't being found:

```bash
# Homebrew (Apple Silicon)
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"

# Homebrew (Intel)
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Conda Environment Issues

If environments aren't activating:

```bash
# Reinitialize conda
conda init zsh

# Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc

# Check if conda is properly configured
conda info
```

### Environment Conflicts

If you're getting dependency conflicts:

```bash
# Create a fresh environment instead of installing to base
mamba create -n myenv python=3.10

# Use strict channel priority
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

## Memory Issues

Bioinformatics tools can be memory-intensive:

```bash
# Monitor memory usage
htop

# Check available memory
vm_stat | head -5
```

### Tips for Memory Management

- Close unnecessary applications during heavy analysis
- Use tools that support streaming (don't load entire files into memory)
- Consider using an HPC cluster for large analyses

## Homebrew Issues

### Package Not Found

```bash
# Update Homebrew first
brew update

# Search for the package
brew search <package_name>

# Search formulas only
brew search --formula <package_name>

# If not available in Homebrew, check bioconda instead
mamba search -c bioconda <package_name>
```

### Upgrade Issues

```bash
# If an upgrade fails, try:
brew cleanup
brew upgrade <package>

# Nuclear option - reinstall
brew uninstall <package>
brew install <package>
```

## VS Code Issues

### Command 'code' Not Found

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P`
3. Type "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
4. Restart your terminal

### Extensions Not Working

```bash
# List installed extensions
code --list-extensions

# Reinstall a problematic extension
code --uninstall-extension <extension-id>
code --install-extension <extension-id>
```

## Git/GitHub Issues

### Authentication Failures

```bash
# Reconfigure GitHub CLI authentication
gh auth logout
gh auth login

# For SSH issues, generate a new key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

### Repository Issues

```bash
# Inspect current state
git status
git log --oneline --decorate -n 5

# Safer option: preserve current work before syncing to remote
git switch -c backup-before-sync-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
git switch main
git fetch origin
git pull --rebase

# Only if you intentionally want to discard local commits/changes on main:
# git reset --hard origin/main
```

## Getting Help

If you're still stuck:

1. **Search the error message** - Often others have encountered the same issue
2. **Check official documentation** - Most tools have troubleshooting sections
3. **GitHub Issues** - Search or open issues on the tool's repository
4. **Stack Overflow** - Great for programming and bioinformatics questions
5. **Biostars** - Community specifically for bioinformatics questions

<Tip>
  When asking for help, always include: the command you ran, the full error message, your operating system version, and relevant tool versions.
