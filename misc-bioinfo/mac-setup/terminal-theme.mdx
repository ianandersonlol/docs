The Dracula theme provides a beautiful, eye-friendly color scheme that's especially good for long coding sessions.

## Installation for Terminal

1. Download the theme:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dracula/terminal-app.git
```

2. Open Terminal preferences (`Cmd+,`)
3. Go to Profiles tab
4. Click the gear icon and select "Import..."
5. Navigate to the downloaded folder and select `Dracula.terminal`
6. Set as default profile

## Installation for VS Code

The Dracula theme is also available for VS Code:

```bash
code --install-extension dracula-theme.theme-dracula
```

Or install through the VS Code Extensions marketplace by searching for "Dracula Official".

## Why Use a Custom Theme?

- **Reduced Eye Strain**: Dark themes with carefully chosen colors are easier on the eyes during long sessions
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Better color contrast makes code more readable
- **Consistency**: Use the same theme across Terminal, VS Code, and other applications

Let's be real. Aesthetics are important. If it looks good you'll feel good while you're working. Is that true? I don't know, but I believe it.

## Other Applications

The Dracula theme is available for many other applications, allowing you to maintain a consistent color scheme across your development environment:

- iTerm2
- Sublime Text
- JetBrains IDEs
- Vim/Neovim
- tmux
- And many more

  This step is completely optional! Use whatever theme makes you most comfortable and productive.
