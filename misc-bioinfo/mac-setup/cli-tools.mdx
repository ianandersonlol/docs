# Core Command Line Utilities

These utilities will become your daily drivers for file manipulation, system monitoring, and data processing.

```bash
brew install htop tree wget curl jq git awk
```

## htop - Interactive Process Viewer

`htop` is an enhanced version of the traditional `top` command, providing a colorful, interactive interface to monitor system processes and resource usage.

```bash
# Launch htop
htop
```

**Why it's important**: Bioinformatics workflows often involve long-running processes that consume significant CPU and memory. `htop` helps you monitor resource usage and identify bottlenecks.

## tree - Directory Structure Visualization

`tree` displays directory contents in a tree-like format, making it easy to understand project structure.

```bash
# Display directory structure
tree

# Limit depth and show only directories
tree -d -L 2
```

## wget & curl - Data Download Tools

Both are essential for downloading datasets, reference genomes, and other files from web servers.

```bash
# Download with wget
wget https://example.com/genome.fasta

# Download with curl
curl -O https://example.com/proteins.faa
```

<Note>
  **Why both?** Different servers and APIs work better with different tools. Many bioinformatics databases provide `curl` commands in their documentation.
</Note>

## jq - JSON Processor

`jq` is invaluable for parsing JSON responses from APIs, which is common when working with biological databases.

```bash
# Pretty print JSON
curl -s "https://api.example.com/gene/BRCA1" | jq '.'

# Extract specific fields
curl -s "https://api.example.com/gene/BRCA1" | jq '.description'
```
