Before installing anything else, you need the Xcode Command Line Tools. These are essential development tools that form the foundation of your bioinformatics environment.

## What are Xcode Command Line Tools?

Xcode Command Line Tools are a collection of development utilities provided by Apple that include:

- **Compilers**: `gcc`, `clang`, and `g++` for compiling C/C++ code (many bioinformatics tools are written in C/C++)
- **Version Control**: `git` for managing code and downloading bioinformatics software from repositories
- **Build Tools**: `make`, `cmake`, and other build systems used by bioinformatics packages
- **Development Libraries**: Essential system libraries that bioinformatics software depends on
- **Command Line Utilities**: Tools like `ld` (linker) and `ar` (archiver) for building software from source

## Why They're Critical for Bioinformatics

Many bioinformatics tools are distributed as source code that needs to be compiled on your system. Without these tools:

- **Package managers** like Homebrew and conda won't work properly
- **Source installations** of tools like BLAST, BWA, or GATK will fail
- **Dependencies** for Python packages (like those requiring compilation) won't install
- **Git repositories** containing bioinformatics pipelines can't be cloned

## Installation

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

This will open a dialog asking if you want to install the command line tools. Click "Install" and wait for the process to complete.

You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
xcode-select -p
```

This should return `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools` if properly installed.

## Verification

Test that key tools are available:

```bash
# Check compiler
gcc --version

# Check git
git --version

# Check make
make --version
```

All commands should return version information without errors.

<Note>
  Once Xcode Command Line Tools are installed, proceed to [Homebrew](/misc-bioinfo/mac-setup/homebrew) to install the package manager.
