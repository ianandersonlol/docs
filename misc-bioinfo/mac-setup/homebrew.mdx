# Homebrew: The Missing Package Manager

</div>

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is an essential package manager for macOS that makes installing and managing software incredibly easy. Think of it as an app store for command-line tools and applications.

## Installation

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After installation, add Homebrew to your PATH (the installer will provide specific instructions for your system):

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

## Why Homebrew is Essential for Bioinformatics

- **Dependency Management**: Automatically handles complex dependencies between tools
- **Version Control**: Easy to install specific versions of bioinformatics tools
- **Bioinformatics Tap**: The `brewsci/bio` tap contains hundreds of specialized bioinformatics packages
- **Easy Updates**: Keep all your tools up to date with simple commands
- **Binary Distribution**: Pre-compiled packages mean faster installation than building from source

## Understanding Formulas vs Casks

Homebrew has two main types of packages:

### Formulas (Command-Line Tools)

**Formulas** are command-line tools and libraries installed with `brew install`:

```bash
# Examples of formulas
brew install samtools
brew install python
brew install wget
brew install git
```

Formulas are typically:
- Command-line programs
- Libraries and dependencies
- Open-source software
- Installed to `/opt/homebrew/bin/` (Apple Silicon) or `/usr/local/bin/` (Intel)

### Casks (GUI Applications)

**Casks** are GUI applications installed with `brew install --cask`:

```bash
# Examples of casks
brew install --cask rstudio
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
brew install --cask github
brew install --cask igv
```

Casks are typically:
- Applications with graphical interfaces
- Installed to `/Applications/`
- Sometimes proprietary software
- .app bundles, .pkg installers, or .dmg files

## Homebrew Tutorial: Common Operations

### Basic Installation

```bash
# Install a formula (command-line tool)
brew install samtools

# Install a cask (GUI application)
brew install --cask rstudio

# Install from a specific tap
brew install brewsci/bio/blast
```

### Searching for Packages

```bash
# Search all packages
brew search blast

# Search only formulas
brew search --formula blast

# Search only casks
brew search --cask genome

# Search in specific tap
brew search brewsci/bio/
```

### Getting Information

```bash
# Get info about a package
brew info samtools

# List installed packages
brew list

# List only formulas
brew list --formula

# List only casks
brew list --cask
```

## Updating and Upgrading

### Update Homebrew Itself

```bash
# Update Homebrew's package definitions (do this regularly!)
brew update
```

This updates Homebrew's local database of available packages and versions, but doesn't upgrade your installed software.

### Upgrade Installed Packages

```bash
# See what packages can be upgraded
brew outdated

# Upgrade ALL packages (formulas and casks)
brew upgrade

# Upgrade specific formula
brew upgrade samtools

# Upgrade specific cask
brew upgrade --cask rstudio

# Upgrade only formulas
brew upgrade --formula

# Upgrade only casks
brew upgrade --cask
```

### Maintenance Commands

```bash
# Clean up old versions and cache
brew cleanup

# See what cleanup would remove (dry run)
brew cleanup --dry-run

# Check system for potential problems
brew doctor

# Get help
brew help
```

## Bioinformatics-Specific Tips

### Add Important Taps

```bash
# Bioinformatics packages
brew tap brewsci/bio

# R packages and tools
brew tap brewsci/science

# List your taps
brew tap
```

### Common Bioinformatics Installations

```bash
# Essential bioinformatics tools (formulas)
brew install samtools bcftools bedtools
brew install brewsci/bio/blast
brew install brewsci/bio/bwa

# GUI applications (casks)
brew install --cask igv
brew install --cask jalview
brew install --cask figtree
```

### Best Practices

```bash
# Weekly maintenance routine
brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup

# Before starting a new project, update everything
brew update && brew doctor

# Check what's installed
brew list | grep bio
```
