# Ordering Genes from Twist Bioscience

Use this workflow for standard gene orders in our lab.

<Note>
  Before placing an order, message Hunter to get the correct PO number. Right after you place the order, message her again with the exact amount charged to that PO. Keeping PO tracking accurate is mandatory.
</Note>

<Note>
  Twist may warn you about a missing stop codon. For this workflow, do not add one manually. Our vector already includes the HIS tag and stop codon. If you add one here, you can break the intended design and end up doing extra cleanup work later (and Justin will make sure it gets fixed).
</Note>

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Start a new order and choose **Gene**

Click **New Order**, then select **Gene** (highlighted in red).

### 5. Upload your FASTA

Drag and drop your FASTA file into the upload area.

### 6. Use the *E. coli* codon usage table

Choose the *E. coli* codon usage table.

### 7. Choose the custom vector

Choose **Custom Vector** and select **BGal Pet-29 b(+)_NdeI_XhoI**.

### 8. Continue once the construct is ready

When setup is complete, click **Continue** (highlighted in red).

### 9. Set custom reading frame

Click **Custom Reading Frame** and select the whole protein.

### 10. Choose the *E. coli* custom reading frame

Select the *E. coli* custom reading frame.

### 11. Select sites to avoid introducing

Open the setting where you choose restriction sites to avoid.

### 12. Confirm selected restriction sites

Confirm that **NdeI** and **XhoI** are selected (as shown).

### 13. Regions to preserve

For our workflows, this is almost never used. Click **Continue**.

### 14. Save optimized sequence

After optimization completes, click **Save**.
